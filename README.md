# Notebook App

This is a notebook app where you can add new notes, search for them, organize and delete.

To add new note you have in your right bottom, Add button that when you click it will popup a form where you can add title, category and the text. The category that you enter will be added to the categories on the left side near All Notes. If the category exist earlier it won't be added! 

We can search for notes or organize them via category. To search with the text you should have the option All available to the Category, otherwise you can't search through the input. 
To organize them you can choose an option to the dropdown list.

These notes will be listed left of the side bar where you can see the title and the date when we created it.
When we click in one of the notes we can see  things like category, title and text that we created the note.

Also you can delete the notes that you stored through the Delete button that is bottom of the notes.
When you delete a note, it will delete also the category in the dropdown if there isn't any notes that have this category otherwise it will be listed there.
All of the notes and options will be saved to the local Storage!
 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
